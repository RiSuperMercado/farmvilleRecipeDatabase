# Farmville Recipe Database
A database for Zynga Farmville Recipes. Later to be a tool to help decide what I should be making or planting and when.

Goals
* Recipe database - search by name, ingridents, cooking time of ingredients, etc
* Inventory database - catalogue what is already made, ingredients and fully done receipes
* Event tasks - what's in my inventory, how many an ingredient needed to finish a task, etc
* GUI to put it all together

For now I'm just going to start throwing together some core code. I'm using Java for now, but plan to integrate SQL later
